    <string name="text_first_story">In Sweden, we have a red Christmas Postbox. 
        The hole december kids can mail their Christmas letter to St. Claus by using 
        the red postbox. There\'s a special post office where this mail is send to.
        Every letter is answered by one of Santas helper.</string>
    <string name="text_second_story">This is my dog Maja. 
        Every year, several hours before Christmas, 
        she puts her dog bags on and leaves the house.
        And right before we are starting to open the Christmas presents, she comes back.
        We believe she is one of Santas helper.</string>
    <string name="text_third_story">I did some research to be able to track 
        down my dog when she disappears again. Turns out that I can track her
        down by putting one of my phones in her bag and track her with another one.
        So, next Christmas, I could find out where she is going.</string>
